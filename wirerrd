wirerrd collect -i INTERFACE -o RRDDIRECTORY -f FILTERFILE [-j THREADS]

This starts the monitoring process on a network interface and stores the
according statistics in round-robin databeses, sorted by the provided filter
rules.

  -i INTERFACE
    The network interface to monitor

  -o RRDDIRECTORY
    The directory for round-robin databases where the collected statistics
    should be stored in

  -f FILTERFILE
    The top level file with wireshark filter rules
    (line format:â€¯"LABEL,WIRESHARKFILTER", without quotations)

  -j THREADS
    The number of tshark instances to use for filtering (called with nice level 5)
    (optional, defaulting to 2 * #CPUs)


wirerrd export -i RRDDIRECTORY -o EXPORTSYMLINK

This reads the collected statistics from the provided round-robin databases
and stores them in RRD-XML exports and renders some graphs.

  -i RRDDIRECTORY
    The directory to read the round-robin databases from

  -o EXPORTSYMLINK
    The symlink is going to point to the directory in /tmp/ where
